    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "Yes! i would like to recommend this model to be used. although this model is not performing up to the mark, but ((((((continuous improvements can refine this model further))) it's performance is much better than random guess. 70% result is considerably well. We can use it with the selected drivers for the feedback. This i beleive needs to be improved.\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "it is difficult to tell exactly what the xgboost model was doing, specially to the people who doesn't have technical background. All I can say is that xgboots model learns in steps or series of estimators with a specific learning rate. It works on reducing the error produced by the last model in the series of estimators. there were some features which were contributing the most, but we don't know how they are related to the gratuity.\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "I was surprised by looking at the feature importance graph that the features that I created had the most imprtance. and I still think that more feature creation will further improve the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "I beleive that the feedback of the customers about the driver could also be a good contributor to the prediction performance. and we can consider other related features as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
